## What is this?
Using the database driver for laravel notifications is great, but then you need a way to communicate to your users if they've not logged in for a while. With Digestif we'll handle the digest emails for you. 

## Installation instructions
1. Install using ```composer require codepotatoltd/digestif```
2. Ensure you have a notifications table in your database, otherwise run ```php artisan notifications:table``` and then ```php artisan migrate```
2. Publish Digestif's config, notification and database migration using ```php artisan vendor:publish``` and select the DigestifServiceProvider option.
4. Run ```php artisan migrate``` to add the "digested_at" column
5. Open the digestif.php config file and update the User model that your app uses.
6. Open your App/Console/Kernel.php and in the scheduler define how often you would like the digest process to run. E.g. ```$schedule->command('digestif:pour')->hourly();``` Alternatively, setup your own cron process to run ```php artisan digestif:pour``` when you would like emails to be sent.
7. Sit back and let Digestif handle the rest ðŸ¥ƒ

## Config options
Using the vendor:publish method you have full control of both the notification that we use behind the scenes. You can find this in your App/Notifications folder and you're welcome to tweak this to something that works better for you. 

For example:

| Config Variable | Default | Description
|---|---|---|
| enabled | true (boolean) | Should Digestif run or not? |
| type | simple (string) | What variety of email should it send. Only one option at the moment |
| user_model | User::class  | What model is used for users that should receive the digest email |
| notifications_user_id_column | notifiable_id (string) | What column on the notifications table stores the user_id |
| read_column | read_at | What column from the notifications table stores whether the notification has been read or not |


## Roadmap
